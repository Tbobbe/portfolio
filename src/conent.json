Naturally, programming and computers are a passion of mine, but I have more interests than just my job. I enjoy being outdoors in nature, especially I like hiking the Swedish mountains in the summer and skiing in the winter. I also have a passion for martial arts. During my young years I practiced a lot of judo and Ju-Jutsu, then later, during my studies at the university, I picked up krav maga. Other than that I enjoy what most people enjoy: A drink on the weekend, traveling on vacation, and good food.",

Five years later, in the summer of 2022, I finished my master's thesis and left Chalmers with a bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering and a master's degree in Algorithms, Languages, and Logic. But my time at Chalmers did not only include studying, I also took part in many student activities and was involved in multiple student commit√©s. My time at the university was without a doubt one of the most fun parts of my life.",

For example typeclasses and monads (they are very useful once you get to know them). Since Haskell is built for functional programming and functional programming only, its syntax is very expressive and one can write code with a lot of functionality using only a few lines. Haskell is also ideal for applying a functional program architecture that yields a safe program, few bugs, and easy maintainability.",

The ease with which you can spawn new processes and send messages between multiple processes made me fall for Erlang. A popular programming language for backend web development, you might have heard of, called Elixir is built on top of Erlang.",
