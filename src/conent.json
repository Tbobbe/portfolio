Naturally, programming and computers is a passion of mine, but I have more interests than just my job. I enjoy being outdoors in nature, especially I like hiking the swedish montains in the summer and skiing in the winter. I also have a passion for martial arts. During my young years I practiced a lot of judo and ju-jutsu, then later, during my studies at the university, I picked up krav maga. Other than that I enjoy what most people enjoy: A drink on the weekend, travelling on vacation and good food.",

Five years alter, in the summer of 2022 i finished my master thesis and left Chalmers with a bachelor in Computer Science and Enginering and a master degree in Algorithms, Languages and Logic. But my time at Chalmers did not only include studying, I also took part in many student activities and was involved in multiple student commités. My time at the university was without a doubt one of the most fun parts of my life.",

For example monads (they are very useful once you get to know them). Since Haskell is built for functionall programming and functional programming oonly, it's syntax is very expressive and one can write code with a lot of functionality using only a few lines. Haskell is also ideal for applying a functional program architecture which yields a program that is safe, has few bugs and is easy to maintain.",
